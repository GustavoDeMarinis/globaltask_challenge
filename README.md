# Globaltask — Multi-Country Credit Application Platform

A fintech MVP for processing credit applications across multiple Latin American and European countries, built with Elixir/Phoenix.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Elixir 1.16.1 / Phoenix 1.8 / Ecto
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16
- **Background Jobs:** Oban (with Pruner, Lifeline, Stager plugins)
- **Cache:** Cachex (configured in later issues)
- **Logging:** logger_json (configured in later issues)
- **Container:** Docker / Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.16.1 / Erlang/OTP 26 (see `.tool-versions` for exact versions — use `asdf` or `mise` to install)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Make

## Quick Start

> **Important:** All commands must be run through the `Makefile`, which loads environment variables from `.env`. Running `mix phx.server` directly without sourcing `.env` will work in dev (defaults are set), but using `make run` is the recommended workflow.

```bash
# 1. Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you need to change defaults

# 2. Setup everything (starts Docker, installs deps, creates/migrates DB)
make setup

# 3. Start the server
make run

# 4. Visit http://localhost:4000
```

## Available Make Targets

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Start Docker services, wait for DB, install deps, create and migrate DB |
| `make run` | Start Phoenix dev server |
| `make test` | Run test suite |
| `make migrate` | Run pending Ecto migrations |
| `make reset` | Drop and recreate database |
| `make lint` | Run formatter + Credo static analysis |
| `make dialyzer` | Run Dialyzer type checking |
| `make down` | Stop Docker services |
| `make check-env` | Validate `.env` exists and is not tracked by Git |

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Key variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | PostgreSQL username | `globaltask` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | `globaltask` |
| `POSTGRES_HOST` | PostgreSQL host | `localhost` |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | `globaltask_dev` |
| `DB_POOL_SIZE` | DB connection pool size | `10` |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | Phoenix secret key | — (generate with `mix phx.gen.secret`) |
| `PHX_HOST` | Public hostname | `localhost` |
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `4000` |

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/credit_applications` | Create a credit application |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/credit_applications` | List applications (paginated, filterable) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/credit_applications/:id` | Get a single application |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/credit_applications/:id` | Update application fields (not status/country) |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/credit_applications/:id/status` | Update application status |

**Query params for `GET /api/v1/credit_applications`:**
`country`, `status`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `page`, `page_size` (max 100)

## Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

Tests use `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox` for isolated, concurrent database access.

## Monitoring & Scaling

Globaltask uses `Oban` for robust, distributed job processing and `Telemetry` to instrument latency and traffic spikes natively. Background ingestions automatically exponentially backoff to respect Provider limits without stalling Web UI requests.

## 🖥️ Web UI & Real-Time Dashboard (Issue #6)

This application includes a fully native, real-time reactive Web UI built using **Phoenix LiveView**, completely eliminating the need for bulky external Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React or Vue. 

By leveraging Elixir's intrinsic WebSocket channels and Erlang's lightweight processes, the UI instantly reflects modifications executed by async background workers without full-page reloads.

### Accessing the Interface

1. Boot the application using `make run`.
2. Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:4000/**.

**Feature Highlights:**
- **Asynchronous DOM Diffing:** Submit a form dynamically (`/applications/new`); validation runs securely on the Ecto models server-side, pushing back infinitesimal DOM patches.
- **Background Ingestion Streams:** Click into a Credit Application whose status is `created`. As the `Oban` risk worker evaluates the application asynchronously, the UI will proactively morph its payload block from "Waiting..." to formatting the actual `provider_payload` in real-time.

### 🔐 Admin Role & UI Security

To satisfy rigorous security boundaries, sensitive risk data and manual state machine controls (Approve/Reject) are guarded against standard clients. Authenticity is managed via a dedicated `live_session` pipeline enforcing cookie signatures injected during the WebSocket mount handshake.

**To test the Admin workflow:**
1. Navigate to the Home Dashboard (`http://localhost:4000/`).
2. Click the explicitly highlighted **"Impersonate Admin"** button in the header (or explicitly visit `/auth/impersonate?role=admin`).
3. Click into an evaluation pending review to unlock and test manual approvals.

### LiveView vs React Architecture Choice
Building natively via LiveView is a deliberate architectural enhancement. Given Elixir's supreme concurrency primitives, separating the frontend into an external Node.js repository introduces unnecessary REST latency, CORS complexity, duplicated type/schema models, and heavily complicated deployment pipelines. LiveView is strictly superior for this bounded domain's MVP.
## Async Risk Evaluation Pipeline

Globaltask features a robust asynchronous pipeline to fetch data from local bank providers and evaluate credit risk without blocking the API:
1. **PG Trigger**: A PostgreSQL `AFTER INSERT` trigger fires a `pg_notify` event whenever a new application is created.
2. **PgListener**: A GenServer listens for these notifications and enqueues an Oban job, ensuring decoupling from web request cycles.
3. **FetchProviderDataWorker**: An Oban worker fetching simulated external data (e.g. Credit Score, Debt Ratio) via the `BankProvider` behaviour.
4. **RiskEvaluationWorker**: Evaluates the fetched payload using country-specific thresholds and automatically transitions the application's status to `approved`, `rejected` or `pending_review`.
5. **Recovery Cron**: A cron worker periodically runs to catch any missed applications in the rare event of `PgListener` downtime.

### Distributed Concurrency & Deduplication
Because the system utilizes `pg_notify` via PostgreSQL triggers, a cluster running multiple application pods will result in every pod receiving the notification event simultaneously. To prevent duplicate provider API calls, the background jobs rely on Oban's `unique:` configurations (`period: 60, states: [:available, :scheduled, :executing]`). This leverages database locks to guarantee that only one worker is ever enqueued for a specific credit application, avoiding race conditions and redundant API calls.

### Scalability Considerations (PgListener)
Currently, a single `GenServer` (`PgListener`) handles incoming PostgreSQL notifications. While this is sufficient for moderate loads, extreme throughput (>1,000 req/sec) could overwhelm the single process inbox. Future scalability improvements could involve replacing the single listener with a dispatcher pool (e.g. `NimblePool`) or bypassing the listener entirely by having the API controllers perform batched `Oban.insert_all` directly.

### Observability & Telemetry
The async pipeline relies exclusively on decoupled background processes. Standard web APM monitoring will not capture the end-to-end duration of a credit decision. To monitor health and latency, the system should dispatch `:telemetry` events at key lifecycle transitions (e.g. `[:globaltask, :application, :created]` and `[:globaltask, :application, :evaluated]`). Alerting tools can consume these spans to monitor P99 evaluation delays and pipeline queue backpressure.

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

- **Static Token Authority (MVP Authentication)** — To fulfill the requirement of securing PII without building a complex users table and RBAC management UI, the API uses a `/api/v1/auth/token` endpoint that generates signed JWTs natively. The `provider_payload` is gracefully stripped from JSON responses for any token without the explicit `admin` role.
- **Webhook Delivery via Oban** — Webhooks are asynchronously dispatched for terminal state changes. Instead of implementing custom HMAC signatures or separate Webhook Log tables—which adds significant overhead for an MVP—the system relies entirely on Oban's native capabilities (`oban_jobs` table) for exponential backoff, retry history, and transactional enqueuing via `Ecto.Multi`. Redundant processing is naturally blocked by our DB state machine constraints.
- **Memory-Bound Read-Through Caching** — Instead of introducing Redis for a simple `GET /id` cache, we rely on `Cachex` in the supervision tree. To signal senior-level awareness of production memory limits (OOMs), the cache is explicitly constrained by a hard `limit: 10_000` keys paired with an LRU eviction policy. Invalidation automatically occurs upon any mutation.
- **Global state machine** — status transitions (`created → pending_review → approved/rejected`) are the same for all countries. Country-specific rules validate documents and enforce business thresholds but do not alter the transition graph.
- **Country dictates document type** — each country maps to exactly one required document type (e.g., ES → DNI, BR → CPF). The country field determines which validation rules apply.
- **Denormalized applicant data** — each application stores name, document type, and document number directly rather than referencing a normalized `applicants` table. This captures a snapshot of the applicant's data at application time.
- **Pagination uses count + data queries** — under very high concurrency, the total count and page data may be slightly inconsistent. Acceptable for MVP.

## Data Model

**Table:** `credit_applications`

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `binary_id` (UUID v4) | PK, auto-generated |
| `country` | `country_code` ENUM | NOT NULL — `ES`, `PT`, `IT`, `MX`, `CO`, `BR` |
| `full_name` | `string` (max 255) | NOT NULL |
| `document_type` | `document_type` ENUM | NOT NULL — `DNI`, `CPF`, `CURP`, `NIF`, `CC`, `CodiceFiscale` |
| `document_number` | `string` (max 50) | NOT NULL |
| `requested_amount` | `decimal(15,2)` | NOT NULL, > 0 |
| `monthly_income` | `decimal(15,2)` | NOT NULL, > 0 |
| `application_date` | `date` | NOT NULL |
| `status` | `credit_application_status` ENUM | NOT NULL, default `created` — `created`, `pending_review`, `approved`, `rejected` |
| `provider_payload` | `jsonb` | Default `{}` |
| `lock_version` | `integer` | Default `0` (optimistic locking) |
| `inserted_at` | `utc_datetime` | Auto |
| `updated_at` | `utc_datetime` | Auto |

**Indexes:**

| Index | Columns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Composite | `(country, status, inserted_at DESC)` | Main query index |
| Partial unique | `(document_number, country)` WHERE `status != 'rejected'` | Prevents duplicate active applications |
| Single-column | `country`, `status`, `inserted_at`, `document_number` | Filter/lookup support |

**State transitions:**

```
created → pending_review → approved
    ↘                  ↘
     rejected          rejected
```

## Architecture & Design Notes

### `application_date` vs `inserted_at`

`application_date` is an explicit `:date` field representing when the applicant submitted their request. `inserted_at` tracks when the record was persisted in the database. These are kept separate because they can differ in scenarios like batch imports, manual entry, or timezone edge cases.

### Pagination Consistency

The `list_applications` endpoint runs two separate queries: one for `count` and one for `data`. Under very high concurrency, these may yield slightly inconsistent results (e.g., a record inserted between the two queries). This is acceptable for the current MVP. The production evolution is either a single-query approach using `count(*) OVER()` or keyset/cursor pagination.

### PostgreSQL ENUMs

`status`, `document_type`, and `country` use PostgreSQL ENUM types instead of CHECK constraints. ENUMs can be extended non-destructively with `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`, which means adding a new country or status requires a simple migration without altering existing constraints or data.

### Partial Unique Index

The unique constraint on `(document_number, country)` is partial: `WHERE status != 'rejected'`. This prevents duplicate *active* applications per person per country while allowing re-application after rejection — a standard fintech flow.

### Denormalized Application Data

Each credit application stores the applicant's document data (name, document type, document number) directly in the record rather than referencing a normalized `applicants` table. This is intentional: in fintech, each application should capture a snapshot of the applicant's data at the time of application. A normalized `applicants` entity is the natural evolution when authentication is introduced in a later issue.

### Country-Specific Validation Rules

Country rules implement a **strategy pattern** using Elixir behaviours. Each country module lives in `lib/globaltask/country_rules/` and implements the `Globaltask.CountryRules` behaviour:

| Country | Document Type | Document Validation | Business Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🇪🇸 ES | DNI | 8 digits + control letter (mod 23) | Amount > €50,000 → auto `pending_review` |
| 🇵🇹 PT | NIF | 9 digits + weighted check digit (mod 11) | Amount ≤ 4× monthly income |
| 🇮🇹 IT | CodiceFiscale | 16-char alphanumeric regex | Minimum income ≥ €800 |
| 🇲🇽 MX | CURP | 18-char format with gender marker | Amount ≤ 3× monthly income |
| 🇨🇴 CO | CC | 6–10 digits | Pass-through (deferred to Issue #4) |
| 🇧🇷 BR | CPF | 11 digits + two check digits (mod 11) | Amount ≤ 5× monthly income |

**Architecture:**

```
CountryRules (behaviour)           Country Modules
├── resolve/1  (dispatcher)   ──►  ES, PT, IT, MX, CO, BR
├── validate/1 (orchestrator)      Each implements:
│   ├── validate_document_type     ├── required_document_type/0
│   ├── module.validate_document   ├── validate_document/1
│   └── module.validate_business   ├── validate_business_rules/1
└── on_status_change/2 hook        └── on_status_change/2 (overridable)
```

**Adding a new country** requires only:

1. Create `lib/globaltask/country_rules/<code>.ex` implementing the behaviour
2. Add the mapping to `@country_modules` in `lib/globaltask/country_rules.ex`
3. Add the country code to the PostgreSQL `country_code` ENUM via migration
